      # we need to generate a special file "compile_commands.json"
      # to do this, we need to run cmake with the following options:
      # -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
      # I'm fairly sure that we don't need to run the actual build,
      # but it's not obvious to me how to do this. So, I'm just going
      # to run a full build for now, and we can FIXME this later.
